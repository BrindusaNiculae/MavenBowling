A player can play a game of bowling.
A game has minimum 10 frames, each frame has maximum 2 rolls.
In a roll, pins are knocked down. Depending on the number of pins knocked down
in a frame, there are 3 types of frames:
    ->strike;(10 pins are knocked down in the first roll of the frame)
    ->spare;(10 pins are knocked down in total in the frame)
    ->open;(less then 10 pins are knocked down in the frame)
The total score is calculated as the sum of partial scores. A partial score is
calculated according to the type of frame:
    ->strike: 10 + the number of pins knocked down in the next 2 rolls;
    ->spare: 10 + the number of pins knocked down in the next roll;
    ->open: the number of pins knocked down in the frame;
