Hello,

The Bowling.java class calculates the score of a valid bowling game.
A valid bowling game consists of 10 frames. The frames from 1 to 9 have maximum 
2 rolls per frame, and the 10-th frame can have maximum 3 rolls(in case of a 
spare or a strike). The total score is calculated as the sum of partial scores 
for each frame.

The maximum number of pins a player can knock down in a frame is 10. Depending
on the number of pins they knock down, there are 3 types of throws, each leading
to a different way to calculate the partial score for that frame:
    ->the STRIKE: 
        -the player knocks down all 10 pins in the first roll;
        -the partial score is calculated as the sum between the current roll and 
         the next 2 rolls;
        -there is no second roll for this frame, the game moves on to the next frame;
    ->the SPARE:
        -the player knocks down a part of the pins in the first roll, and the
         rest (up to 10) in the second roll;
        -the partial score is calculated as the sum between this frame and the next roll;
    ->OPEN:
        -the player does not knock down all 10 pins in the frame;
        -the partial score is calculated as the sum of the knocked down pins;
There are 2 exceptions to the game depending on the throw in frame 10:
    ->in case of STRIKE the player is allowed 2 more rolls;
    ->In case of SPARE the player is allowed 1 more roll;
In case all 12 throws were STRIKES the final score will be 300.

The java class gets a vector of type int as an input (the vector represents the
total of rolls for that specific game), and returns the total score.
